# Pushing through uncomfortable moves

This is a useful tip that one of my climbing friends gave me.

I was trying a boulder and struggling with one particular move that felt uncomfortable. I kept focusing on holding the handhold properly and trying to settle into it, but while staying there, I wasn’t able to continue. Every time I tried to move to the next hold, I would fall.

Then my friend told me that sometimes you just need to push through an uncomfortable move, knowing that the next hold is going to be a better one. Not to waste energy trying to make a bad hold feel comfortable if this is too hard. Instead, move through the discomfort without being too slow, and you’ll reach the next hold where you can rest.

I tried this advice, and it worked. Even though I felt insecure and thought I might fall, I didn’t stop. I kept moving, and I was able to grab the next hold, which was a jug. From there, I could continue climbing the boulder.

That small tip really helped me improve my climbing. It also made me realize something: sometimes you’ll face uncomfortable positions, and you can’t stay there forever. If your strength, technique and body position allow it, you need to push through the discomfort. Even if you feel like you’re about to fall, once you grab the next hold if it's a good one you will be able leave the uncomfortable position eventually behind.
